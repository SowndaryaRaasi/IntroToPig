                        Introduction toPig
                          Assignment 6.2
1. Why MapReduce program is needed in Pig Programming?
   *Pig programming uses pig latin language to write pig scripts.
   *Although pig scripts are easy and reduce no. of lines of code, finally they get converted into map reduce jobs by pig engine
     which needs map reduce program to process such jobs.
   *So,map reduce program is needed in pig programming.

2. What are advantages of Pig over MapReduce?
     *Decrease in development time. 
     *Easy to understand and develop.
     *Lines Of Code gets minimised to 16 times.
     *Since it is procedural, control of the execution of every step is possible.
     *UDF(User Defined Functions) can be written and injected at any point.
     *Easy to join multiple tables. 

3. What is Pig engine and what is its importance:
    *Pig scripts have to pass through the following components to produce the expected results:
           1.Parser
           2.Optimiser
           3.Compiler
           4.Execution Engine
    *Pig engine is where map reduce jobs are executed.
           *The MapReduce jobs are submitted to Hadoop in a sorted order. 
           *Finally, these MapReduce jobs are executed on Hadoop producing the desired results.
    *IMPORTANCE:
           *It acts as an interpreter between pig latin script and map reduce jobs.
           *It creates an environment to execute pig scripts in a series of map reduce jobs in parallel manner.

4. What are the modes of Pig execution?
   1.Local Mode:
           *No need to install hadoop.
           *Pig scripts run in local system.Pig store data in file system.
           *Java and pig installation is mandatory.
   2.MapREduce Mode:
           *It is mandatory to start hadoop.
           *Pig scripts are stored and run in HDFS
            *Java and pig installation is mandatory.

5. What is Grunt Shell in Pig?
    *The Grunt shell of Apache Pig is mainly used to write Pig Latin scripts. 
     *Also,there are certain useful shell and utility commands provided by the Grunt shell.

6. What are the features of Pig Latin language?
    *It is a data flow language.
    *It supports interoperability
    *It supperts parallelism.
    *It is very easy and reduces the no. of lines of code to a great extent.
    *It improves efficiency.
    
    
7. Is Pig Latin commands case sensitive?
    * The names of Pig Latin functions,relations,fields,  are case sensitive.
    * All other Pig Latin keywords are case insensitive.
    * E.g: Keywords LOAD, USING, AS, GROUP, BY, FOREACH, GENERATE, and DUMP are case insensitive. 
       They can also be written as load, using, as, group, by, etc.

8. What is a data flow language? 
    *Data flow programming language is a kind of progrmming in which  a program is modelled as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations.
    *It implements dataflow principles and architecture.It internally represents applications as a directed graph, 
      similarly to a dataflow diagram. Applications are represented as a set of nodes
